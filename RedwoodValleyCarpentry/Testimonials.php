    	<p><strong class="testtitle2">James and Brittany, Ajax</strong><br />We highly recommend Stephan Braker from Redwood Valley Carpentry. We were able to design a custom shed to suit our family's needs. Not only was it custom, the workmanship was beyond our expectations. The finished product is not only beautiful, but also very durable and functional. Stephan is very knowledgeable concerning the trade. We never doubted his expertise. He was hard working, while maintaining within time restraints. Great workmanship, great quality, great shed. Thank you Stephan!<br /><br />
        <strong class="testtitle2">Kevin and Anna, Rockland</strong><br />I want to express my thanks for the fine custom work performed by Stephan Braker in building our backyard deck last May 2011.  It's a beautiful deck and my wife and I have made good use of it thus far. I know we will continue to enjoy it for many years to come. Stephan was so polite, worked really hard for us and kept a clean job site.  We appreciate your quality workmanship Stephan!<br /><br />
        <strong class="testtitle2">Deb and Jamie, Pickering</strong><br />Stephan did a phenomenal job building our backyard shed.  His work, right down to the last detail, is meticulous and of the highest quality!  He is incredibly competent and efficient and, over all a pleasure to work with!  Two of my family members have had sheds built by Stephan as well, and both have been extremely pleased and satisfied with his work.  I would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a skilled carpenter. <br /><br />
        <p><strong class="testtitle2">Donna, Bowmanville, Ontario</strong><br />I am so pleased with my new shed! Stephan was very helpful in making the decision on how the final product would look.  He built it well and it is very solid and sturdy- exactly what I wanted. Thank you Stephan!</p>

    <p><strong class="testtitle2">Linda, Oshawa</strong><br />Researched for best material, quality, appearance and cost.  Not only received all three, but the job was done and done well in one day!<br />Highly recommended!</p>
    <p><strong class="testtitle2">Maggie and Steve, Markham</strong><br />April 2012: I would highly recommend Redwood Valley Carpentry. I have a large cedar shed in my back yard that needed re-roofing and Redwood Valley stripped the shingles and did a beautiful job with new cedar shakes. Despite the horrible weather that day, (windy, raining, and exceptionally cold) quality work was still done, the job site cleaned and all waste removed from the site. A month later I still have not seen a single nail left behind. Great job!
